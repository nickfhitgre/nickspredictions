<p>Welcome to Nick's Snow Day Predictions! Snow day predictions will happen from me whenever there is a chance of a snow day!</p>
<br>
<h1>Tuesday, January 21</h1>
<p>With cold temperatures coming, it could be too cold for school to happen.</p>
<p>The rule for cold temperatures is if the wind chill is -20 or below, school will be cancelled.</p>
<p>Around 12AM, it will be around -20, and it will get colder, until around 6am. Wind chills could get as low as around -30.</p>
<p>Due to this, I will believe that there is a 90% chance of school being cancelled on tuesday.</p><br>
<p>Send this to more people for good luck!</p>
